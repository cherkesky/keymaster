Coming soon. Keymaster is a tool for Airbnb owners to streamline their guest's check-in/out procedure.
Every day at checkin time Keymaster reaches out to check if there are any guests coming in today, generates a custom user code based on the last 4 digits of the customer's phone number, and then reaches out to the property's smart hub with a request to program the locks. On check-out time the tool will delete the key codes from the locks (can also set the smart thermostat to 'eco' mode as an option).
